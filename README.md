|CS224n:| [Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)|Stanford|Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies of the information age, and a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate almost everything in language: web search, advertising, emails, customer service, language translation, virtual agents, medical reports, etc. In recent years, Deep Learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks, using single end-to-end neural models that do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this course, students will gain a thorough introduction to cutting-edge research in Deep Learning for NLP. Through lectures, assignments and a final project, students will learn the necessary skills to design, implement, and understand their own neural network models. This year, CS224n will be taught for the first time using PyTorch rather than TensorFlow (as in previous years).|



|CS 11711| [Algorithms for NLP](http://demo.clab.cs.cmu.edu/11711fa18/)|CMU|This course will explore current statistical techniques for the automatic analysis of natural (human) language data. The dominant modeling paradigm is corpus-driven statistical learning, with a split focus between supervised and unsupervised methods. This term we are making Algorithms for NLP a lab-based course. Instead of homeworks and exams, you will complete four hands-on coding projects. This course assumes a good background in basic probability and a strong ability to program in Java. Prior experience with linguistics or natural languages is helpful, but not required. There will be a lot of statistics, algorithms, and coding in this class.Slides, materials, and projects for this iteration of Algorithms for NLP are borrowed from Dan Jurafsky at Stanford, Dan Klein and David Bamman at UC Berkeley and Nathan Schneider at Georgetown|

|TCD 2018|[Quantitative Text Analysis](https://kenbenoit.net/quantitative-text-analysis-tcd-2018/)|LSE|The course surveys methods for systematically extracting quantitative information from political text for social scientific purposes, starting with classical content analysis and dictionary-based methods, to classification methods, and state-of-the-art scaling methods and topic models for estimating quantities from text using statistical techniques. The course lays a theoretical foundation for text analysis but mainly takes a very practical and applied approach, so that students learn how to apply these methods in actual research. The common focus across all methods is that they can be reduced to a three-step process: first, identifying texts and units of texts for analysis; second, extracting from the texts quantitatively measured features - such as coded content categories, word counts, word types, dictionary counts, or parts of speech - and converting these into a quantitative matrix; and third, using quantitative or statistical methods to analyse this matrix in order to generate inferences about the texts or their authors. The course systematically covers these methods in a logical progression, with a practical, hands-on approach where each technique will be applied using appropriate software to real texts.|
